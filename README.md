YOUTUBE-CLONE-YC

# Project Title
YouTube Clone

# Description
This program is built using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and Javascript (JS)

# Installation
1. After Downloading The Files, gather it into a folder (folder's name could be of your choice, i'll prefer to keep it as "YouTube")
2. Keep all the files with (.jpg) extensions in a folder named "sourceImg"
3. Keep all the files with (.ttf) extensions in a folder named "Fonts"
4. Keep the name of the file as it is, because it is programmed with such attribute, or else if you can edit the code, you are good to go
5. You'll be needing any Integrated Development Environment IDE (i used VS Code), or even you can run it through Notepad Editor

# Features
1. It involves a very handy use of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and Javascript (JS)
2. It executes a very basic implimentation of original youtube website

# Contributing
You can contribute to my code in following ways : -

1. Since the program contains a search bar and it is currently inactive, one could try to make it a working bar.
2. Since the program contains a voice control search option (mic) and it is currently inactive, one could try to make it a working mic.
3. I wish to include a "Log Out" functionality, which resets all the current user information like to delete the profile picture, url connected to my own youtube account's "Settings", "Report History", "Youtube Studio Creater", "Go Live".
